#
# This token file declares what values are programmed for manufacturing
# tokens on the chip. It can be read back by the "flash" or "convert" commands.
#
# Lines are composed of one of the following forms:
#   <token-name> : <data>
#   <token-name> : !ERASE!
#
# Omitted tokens are left untouched and not programmed on the chip.
# Token names are case INsensitive.  All integer values are interpreted as hexadecimal
# numbers in BIG-endian format and must be prefixed with '0x'.  Blank lines and 
# lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
# Byte arrays are given in hexadecimal format, without a leading 0x.
# Specifying !ERASE! for the data sets that token to all F's.
#
#
# The token data can be in one of three main forms: byte-array, integer, or string.
# Byte-arrays are a series of hexadecimal numbers of the required length.
# Integers are BIG endian hexadecimal numbers.
# String data is a quoted set of ASCII characters.
