# Bluetooth Mesh - GATEWAY

## Getting Started

To learn Bluetooth mesh technology basics, see [Bluetooth Mesh Network - An Introduction for Developers](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mesh-Technology-Overview.pdf).

To get started with Bluetooth Mesh and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG176: Bluetooth Mesh SDK v2.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg176-bluetooth-mesh-sdk-v2x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

The term SoC stands for "System on Chip", meaning that this is a standalone application that runs on the EFR32/BGM and does not require any external MCU or other active components to operate.

To add or remove features from the example, follow this process:

- Add model and feature components to your project
- Optionally configure the Mesh node through the "Bluetooth Mesh Configurator"

To learn more about programming an SoC application, see [UG472: Silicon Labs Bluetooth 速 Mesh Configurator User's guide for SDK v2.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug472-bluetooth-mesh-v2x-node-configuration-users-guide.pdf).

- Some components are configurable, and can be customized using the Component Editor

- Respond to the events raised by the Bluetooth stack
- Implement additional application logic

[UG295: Silicon Labs Bluetooth 速 Mesh C Application Developer's Guide for SDK v2.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug295-bluetooth-mesh-dev-guide.pdf) gives code-level information on the stack and the common pitfalls to avoid.

## GUILINE - GATEWAY Application

To make gateway node the application, do the following:

1. Make sure a bootloader is installed. See the Troubleshooting section.
2. Build and flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Switch** example to the device.
3. Add component: Sensor Client, Generic Server Models
4. In dcd_config.btmeshconf, add models: Generic OnOff Server
5. Config component Generic Base: Enable Generic On/Off Server
6. Copy file below into project:
 app.c, app.h,
 app_out_log.c, app_out_log.h,
 gateway_define.h
 sl_btmesh_uuid.c,sl_btmesh_uuid.h
7. In file sl_bluetooth.c: add function sl_btmesh_set_my_uuid(evt) before function
sl_bt_provisionee_on_event(evt). And then build and flash to device again.
8. Provision the device in one of three ways:

   - NCP Host provisioner examples, see for example an SDK folder `app/btmesh/example_host/btmesh_host_provisioner` or [github](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/bluetooth_mesh_stack_features/tree/master/provisioning)

   - NCP Commander with NCP target device, see [Bluetooth NCP Commander guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-tools-bluetooth-ncp-commander) or [AN1259: Using the v3.x Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf)

   - For Mobile Phone use, see the [QSG176: Bluetooth Mesh SDK v2.x Quick-Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg176-bluetooth-mesh-sdk-v2x-quick-start-guide.pdf) for more information how to download and use the Silicon Labs Bluetooth Mesh application.

   Mobile Phone provisioning is illustrated in the following figure.

9. Open the app, choose the Provision Browser, and tap **Scan**.

10. Tap **PROVISION** and continue provisioning.

11. Select the right "Group" and then tap the "Functionality" menu.

12.  Press button 0 to start the scanning device in mesh. After that, the console menu appears. 
Enter character correct as required shown in the console menu.

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To install a bootloader, from the Launcher perspective's EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS tab either build and flash one of the bootloader examples or run one of the precompiled demos. Precompiled demos flash a bootloader as well as the application image.

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Switch** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - NCP Empty** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
